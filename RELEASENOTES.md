v1.2.0-alpha
------
<em>Release date: June 20, 2024</em><br/>
<em>Changes since: <strong>v1.1.x</strong></em><br/>

<em><strong>Attention:</strong> Some configuration files were changed in pgModeler 1.2.0-alpha causing a break in backward compatibility with some pgModeler 1.1.x settings. This way, at the first start of the newer version, pgModeler will automatically try to migrate the older settings to the newer ones!</em><br/><br/>

After a work of 3 months here we are announcing pgModeler 1.2.0-alpha which bundles 20 new features, 26 improvements, and 22 bug fixes. Most are not directly visible to the user but will enhance the overall experience when designing database models or managing live databases. Below, is a summary of some key improvements in pgModeler 1.2.0-alpha. For detailed information about the changes in this version, please, refer to the CHANGELOG.md file.

* **Improved schema microlanguage:** The pgModeler's code templating language (aka schema microlanguage) was improved in such a way as to support escaped character sequences that refer to metacharacter tokens. The supported escaped characters (and their related metacharacters) are \s ($sp), \t ($tb), \n ($br), \[ ($ob), \] ($cb), \{ ($oc), \} ($cc), \$ ($ds), \# ($hs), \% ($ps), \@ ($at), \& ($am), \\ ($bs) and \* ($ds). The schema language now also supports the @include statements that inject portions of code stored in other files into the currently parsed schema file. This is pretty handy for avoiding code duplication and facilitating the maintenance of schema files. <br/>

* **Markdown data dictionaries:** pgModeler now supports the generation of data dictionaries in Markdown (.md) format in the model export form. This is useful to integrate data dictionaries generated by the tool with other documentation tools that use that file format to keep documentation pages. The pgmodeler-cli tool also received support for Markdown dictionaries through the option "--markdown".
		
* **Improved older configs copy:** From now on, in the first run, pgModeler will try to copy the configuration files from a previous major version immediately before the current one. For example, running 1.2 the files to be copied will be from 1.1 and not from 0.9.x anymore. This will increase the chances of reusing settings from previous versions diminishing the annoying situation of reconfiguring the tool every time it is updated.

* **Improved code generation:** The DDL generation for objects that support "CREATE OR REPLACE" was updated to include the "OR REPLACE" portion, this is the case for functions, procedures, views, and others. The diff feature received the option "Replace modified objects" which causes objects to be replaced via "CREATE OR REPLACE" instead of being dropped and created again.

* **Miscellaneous: **
		* The restriction of specifying OUT parameters in procedures was removed in compliance with newer PostgreSQL versions.
		* Added support for the options check_option, security_invoker, and security_barrier in views.
		* The syntax highlighting feature was completely refactored being now more precise and the configuration files more simple.
		* The support for "Forced object recreate" in the diff feature was dropped. The option was confusing and was generating a diff code that was similar to generating the entire SQL of a model and re-export it to a server. So, it was considered not so useful anymore.		
		* Minor fix in pgmodeler-cli in such a way as to warn about invalid changelog entries avoiding aborting the entire model fix process.
		* Fixed a bug in the reverse engineering feature that was not retrieving comments of sequences causing false positives to be generated in the diff process.
